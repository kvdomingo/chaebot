A Discord bot to pull random ~~ITZY~~ k-pop idol pics from public fan accounts on Twitter and post them to a Discord server channel.

## Supported groups/idols
- ITZY
- BLACKPINK
- TWICE
- RED VELVET
- IU
- BTS
- MAMAMOO

## Usage
The bot is currently in `beta` phase. Shoot me an email to request access!

If I have already sent you an access link (which should automatically add the bot to your selected server), you don't need to do anything else. Send a `!help` command to the bot (either by DM or server) to list all the commands.
