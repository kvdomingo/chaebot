A bot written in Python for K-pop Discord servers.

## Features
- Hourly posts of a random member from the selected group
- On-demand post of a specific idol
- Notifications when a group/idol starts streaming on VLIVE
- ++ more in progress... 

## Supported groups/idols
- ITZY
- BLACKPINK
- TWICE
- RED VELVET

- MAMAMOO

## Usage
The bot is currently in `beta` phase. Shoot me an email to request access!

If I have already sent you an access link (which should automatically add the bot to your selected server), you don't need to do anything else. Send a `!help` command to the bot (either by DM or server) to list all the commands.
