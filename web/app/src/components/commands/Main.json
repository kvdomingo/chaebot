Group name must be typed as a single word (replace spaces with dashes or underscores). Member name can be typed out as multiple words. Group/member names have multiple aliases and should match the target group/member given sensible aliases (e.g. to query BTS, the following aliases will work: bts, bangtan, bangtan-sonyeondan, bangtan-boys; to query RM, the following aliases should also work: rm, rap monster, namjoon, kim namjoon). Parameters are case-insensitive, but the command name itself is not."
